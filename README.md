# 🏏 The Untold Stories of IPL – Beyond the Numbers

## 📌 Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** from 2008 to 2024. Unlike typical dashboards that highlight win counts or title tallies, this study uncovers deep, data-driven narratives about **team dominance, player consistency, playoff pressure, rivalries**, and **brand value dynamics** using advanced data visualization techniques.

> 🎯 Our goal: Transform complex IPL statistics into compelling, human-centered insights through storytelling and visual analysis.

## 🧠 Motivation

Despite massive interest in the IPL, most analyses focus on aggregate stats. We sought to understand:
- What makes teams and players consistently successful?
- How does playoff pressure impact performance?
- Do wins translate to popularity and brand value?
- Which rivalries define the IPL narrative?
